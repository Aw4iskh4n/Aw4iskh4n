👋 Hi, I’m @Aw4iskh4n, a BS student majoring in Cyber Security. Beyond academia, I've cultivated a passion for web development and graphic design which I've turned into an expert-level hobby.

👀 I’m deeply interested in exploring the confluence of cyber security principles with web applications, and how design can enhance user experience without compromising security.

🌱 I’m currently delving deeper into advanced cyber security techniques and protocols, always looking to integrate them seamlessly into web solutions.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals on projects that intersect the domains of web development, graphic design, and cyber security. Let's innovate together!
